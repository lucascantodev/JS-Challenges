Team Lineup
Build a web page that allows you to assemble a lineup for a team of players. It should be possible to:

Add a player to the lineup
Provide the player's position in the team.
Provide the player's name.
Provide the player's jersey number.
Have an "Add" button that asks the user to confirm the addition of that player and then inserts the information into a list on the page.
After the player is added, the text fields should be cleared.
Remove a player from the lineup
Provide the player's jersey number.
Have a "Remove" button that asks the user to confirm the removal of that player and then removes them from the list on the page.
After the player is removed, the text field should be cleared.
Tip: Remember that it is possible to access the text of an input through the value property.

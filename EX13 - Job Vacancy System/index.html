        <h1>Job Vacancy System</h1>
        <p>Write a JavaScript program that simulates a job vacancy system, where you can manage job listings and add candidates to those listings. It should meet the following requirements:</p>
        <p>Have a menu where you can choose from different functionalities of the system:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>List available job vacancies</li>
            <ul>
            <li>The option to list job vacancies should display the index, name, and the number of registered candidates for all job vacancies.</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
            <li>Create a new job vacancy</li>
            <ul>
            <li>The option to create a new job vacancy should ask for a name, description, and a deadline for the vacancy. It should also ask the user to confirm the information before saving it.</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
            <li>View a job vacancy</li>
            <ul>
            <li>The option to view a job vacancy should ask for the index of the vacancy and display all its information: index, name, description, deadline, number of candidates, and the names of the candidates.</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
            <li>Register a candidate for a vacancy</li>
            <ul>
            <li>The option to register a candidate for a vacancy should ask for the candidate's name, the vacancy index, and then display a confirmation with the vacancy's information before saving the candidate for the vacancy.</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
            <li>Delete a vacancy</li>
            <ul>
            <li>The option to delete a vacancy should ask for the index of the vacancy, display its information, and ask the user to confirm the deletion before actually deleting it.</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
            <li>Exit</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        </ul>
    </div>

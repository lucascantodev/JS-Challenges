        <h1>Waiting Queue</h1>
        <p>Write a JavaScript program to simulate a waiting queue in a medical office.</p>
        <p>The program should start by displaying an interactive menu on the screen with the following options:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>List of patients waiting in order, showing their position next to the name (e.g., 1st Matheus, 2nd Marcos, etc).</li>
            <li>Add a new patient to the end of the queue (asking for the patient's name).</li>
            <li>Consult the next patient in the queue and display the name of the consulted patient.</li>
            <li>Exit the program</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The program should only be terminated when the "Exit" option is chosen; otherwise, it should return to the menu.</p>

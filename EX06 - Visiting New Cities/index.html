        <h1>Visiting Cities</h1>
        <p>Write a JavaScript program that asks for the name of a tourist and then inquires whether they have visited any cities. If the answer is yes, ask for the name of the city and store it in a variable. Continue asking if the tourist has visited any other cities until the answer is no. Finally, the program should display the tourist's name, the number of cities visited, and which cities they visited.</p>

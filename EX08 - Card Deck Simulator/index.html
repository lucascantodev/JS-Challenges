        <h1>Card Deck Simulator</h1>
        <p>Write a JavaScript program to simulate a deck of cards. The program should start by displaying an interactive
            menu on the screen, showing the current number of cards in the deck, and the options to "Add a card," "Draw
            a card," or "Exit."</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choosing "Add a card" should prompt the user for the card's name and add it to the top of the deck.</li>
            <li>Choosing "Draw a card" should remove the top card from the deck and display the name of the drawn card
                on the screen.</li>
            <li>The program should only exit when the "Exit" option is chosen; otherwise, it should return to the menu.
            </li>
        </ol>

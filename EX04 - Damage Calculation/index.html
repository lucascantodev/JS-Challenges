        <h1>Damage Calculation</h1>
        <p>Write a program that allows you to enter the name and attack power of one character, then the name, amount of health points, defense power, and whether the other character has a shield. Then, calculate the amount of damage based on the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the attack power is greater than the defense and the defender does not have a shield, the damage inflicted will be equal to the difference between the attack and defense.</li>
            <li>If the attack power is greater than the defense and the defender has a shield, the damage inflicted will be equal to half of the difference between the attack and defense.</li>
            <li>If the attack power is less than or equal to the defense, the damage inflicted will be 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, the program should subtract the damage amount from the health points of the defending character and display on the screen the amount of damage and the updated information for both characters.</p>
